    "The tabla is a traditional Indian percussion instrument widely used in classical, folk, and popular music. It consists of two hand-played drums: the smaller drum (dayan) made from wood and the larger drum (bayan) typically made from metal, clay, or a combination of materials. ü•Å",
    "Structure: The dayan has a high pitch and is played with the dominant hand, while the bayan provides a deeper, resonant sound and is played with the non-dominant hand. Both drums have unique tuning and playing techniques, allowing for a variety of rhythms and tonal expressions.",
    "Playing Technique: Tabla players use their fingers and palms to create intricate rhythms (tala). The strokes (bols) have specific names and are played in combinations to produce complex rhythmic patterns. Skilled tabla players can execute rapid sequences and improvisations, making it a highly expressive instrument.",
    "Cultural Significance: The tabla is integral to Indian classical music, often accompanying vocalists, instrumentalists, and dancers. It enhances the overall musical experience and is a staple in Hindustani (North Indian) classical music, showcasing the intricate interplay of rhythm and melody.",
    "Modern Usage: Beyond classical settings, the tabla has found its place in various music genres, including fusion, world music, and contemporary pop. Its versatility allows it to blend with different musical styles, making it a favorite among musicians worldwide."
